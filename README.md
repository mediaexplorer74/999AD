## Status
- UWP app (quickly tested on my Lumia 950 and 640, and old notebooks Sony Vaio & Surface Pro 4)
- Min. Win. SDK = 10240, and Win. SDK 19041 used
- Alpha version is ready (but save game data not reconstructed yet, and screen scaling problems are still here/there)
- Semi-God mode activated (jump power increased, and lifeTimes always is 5))

## ToDo
- Fix System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters (compatibility with UAP 10240)
- Fix load objects bug
- Fix Save game data / load game data
- Fix screen scaling problem (strange borders.... so, check (int)(float) deils! )
- Fix sound distortion in mega-boss end scene (and boss super-power so strang, game mission impossible!!)
- Add some cool music theme ;)
